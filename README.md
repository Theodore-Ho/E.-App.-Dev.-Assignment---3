The assignment is about using Express and Node.js environment to develop a minor SPA site, display the colour, and include CRUD operations.

### Requirements Result

- I have achieved all the requirements:
    - README file (1 pts)
    - Discussions (2.5 pts)
    - Express.js backend (2 pts). Additionally, I have a complete verification scheme, which can avoid data modification caused by API tools sending requests with wrong colors.
    - Frontend (3 pts). Additionally, I have a linkage function and a color picker when modifying color data. Unfortunately, the linkage when editing HSL is not perfect, it is caused by the mechanism of HSL. HSL is very different from RGB and HEX.
    - Cookies (1.5 pts)
